    <h2>About Tom</h2>
    <p>Welcome to my debut website! I am an aspiring web developer, passionate about reclaiming the modern internet and refactoring it for the benefit of society. I believe a social movement to remake the internet is possible and can succeed. I want to actively contribute to the assembly of alternative tools and technologies and I am currently founding a UK-based biodiversity monitoring start-up, which could benefit massively from the integration of web-based technology! I see FAC as the perfect place to learn skills while I found this social enterprise.</p>

    <h2>Why Web Development</h2>
    <p>Through expanding my web development skillset, I want to deepen my understanding of the fundamental building blocks of the internet—HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—and how these technologies come together to create the seamless digital experiences we rely on every day. Beyond mastering the basics, I am particularly excited about exploring how nascent technologies, such as artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things (IoT), can be integrated with web development. By harnessing these innovations, I aspire to create transformative tools and platforms that not only enhance our daily lives but also redefine how we interact with the digital world.</p>

    <h2>What I’ve Learned - Relevant Modules & Training</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>HTML - Essential learning on freeCodeCamp, plus extras on Scrimba.</li>
      <li>CSS - As above, I've completed core modules on freeCodeCamp and experimented on Scrimba.</li>
      <li>JavaScript - Essential training complete, plus I have now reached 6 Kyu on CodeWars. I have found JavaScript challenging but rewarding to learn so far (after some initial head scratching!)</li>
