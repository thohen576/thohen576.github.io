    <h2>About Tom</h2>
    <p>Welcome to my debut website! I am an aspiring web developer, passionate about reclaiming the modern internet and refactoring it for the benefit of society. I believe a social movement to remake the internet is possible and can succeed. And now, armed with an understanding of the modern policy, regulatory and investment environment, I want to take the next step in my journey and actively contribute to the assembly of alternative tools and technologies for the people. I am currently founding a UK start-up focused on radically transforming biodiversity regulation across the UK's Real Estate sector, and I see FAC as the perfect place to learn essential skills while that next step...</p>

    <h2>What I’ve Learned</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>HTML - I've completed the relevant training courses on freeCodeCamp and additional modules on Scrimba! I've enjoyed it so far, particularly once I understood how the language is linked to CSS and JavaScript.</li>
      <li>CSS - As for HTML, I've follwed FAC's suggested training courses and experimented a little outside of the core content. I'm looking forward to becoming more proficient and fluent in using CSS!</li>
      <li>JavaScript - Having completed the fundamental trainings and practiced on Codewars, I have found JavaScript challenging but more powerful - I can now appreciate why the language is so popular and widely used!</li>
